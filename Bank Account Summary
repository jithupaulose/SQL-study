# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH sentTrans AS
(
    SELECT
        paid_by as user_id,
        SUM(amount) as paid
    FROM Transactions
    GROUP BY paid_by
),
recievedTran AS
(
SELECT
    paid_to as user_id,
    SUM(amount) as recieved
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY paid_to
)

SELECT
    U.user_id,
    U.user_name,
    (U.credit - IFNULL(paid,0) + IFNULL(recieved,0) )  AS credit,
    CASE WHEN (U.credit - IFNULL(paid,0) + IFNULL(recieved,0) )  < 0 THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS credit_limit_breached
FROM Users U
LEFT JOIN sentTrans ST
    ON U.user_id = ST.user_id
LEFT JOIN recievedTran RT
    ON U.user_id = RT.user_id


SOLUTION 2:


WITH CTE_JOIN AS
(
    SELECT paid_by AS user_id, -amount AS amount FROM Transactions
    UNION ALL
    SELECT paid_to AS user_id, amount FROM Transactions   
),
CTE_Group_Amount AS
(
        SELECT user_id,
            SUM(amount) AS total_amount
        FROM CTE_JOIN
        GROUP BY 1
    UNION
        SELECT user_id, 
        0 AS total_amount
        FROM Users
        WHERE user_id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM CTE_JOIN)
)
SELECT
U.user_id,
U.user_name,
SUM(CTE.total_amount + credit) AS credit,
CASE WHEN SUM(total_amount + credit) < 0 THEN "Yes" ELSE "No" END AS credit_limit_breached
FROM Users U
JOIN CTE_Group_Amount CTE
ON U.user_id = CTE.user_id
GROUP BY 1
