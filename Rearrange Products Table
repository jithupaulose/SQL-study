https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-products-table/

# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One table: Products
product_id is the primary key
Products table indicates the product's price in 3 different stores.
product is not available in a store, the price will be null

PROBLEM: rearrange the Products table so that each row has (product_id, store, price). If a product is not available in a store, do not include a row.

STEPS:
    1. Create a mainCTE for getting the layout with UNION ALL
    2. 'store1' AS store, store1 as price for 1,2,3 stores
    3. SELECT the required fields where condition price is not null
    
*/
WITH mainCTE AS
(
    SELECT
        product_id,
        'store1' AS store,
        store1 AS price
    FROM Products
UNION ALL
    SELECT
        product_id,
        'store2' AS store,
        store2 AS price
    FROM Products   
UNION ALL
    SELECT
        product_id,
        'store3' AS store,
        store3 AS price
    FROM Products
)
SELECT
    product_id,
    store,
    price
FROM mainCTE
WHERE price is not null
