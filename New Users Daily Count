# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One Table: Traffic
No primary keys

PROBLEM:
Reports for every date within at most 90 days from today, the number of users that logged in for the first time on that date. Assume today is 2019-06-30.

STEPS:

CTE with dense_rank() over(partition by user_id order by activity_date) rnk
where activity = 'login'
filter it via:
take all rnk = 1
and datediff('2019-06-30',activity_date) <=90
having (user_id ) > 0

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    user_id,
    activity_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(partition by user_id order by activity_date asc) as rnk
FROM Traffic
WHERE activity = 'login'
)

SELECT
    activity_date AS login_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count
FROM CTE
WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-06-30',activity_date) <=90 AND rnk = 1
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(user_id) >0
