# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Calls
Calls table does not have a primary key, it may contain duplicates.
table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id

PROBLEM: report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons (person1, person2) where person1 < person2.


WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT 
        from_id AS person1,
        to_id AS person2,
        duration
    FROM Calls
    WHERE from_id < to_id
UNION ALL
    SELECT
        to_id AS person1,
        from_id AS person2,
        duration
    FROM Calls
    WHERE to_id < from_id

)
SELECT 
    person1,
    person2,
    COUNT(*) AS call_count,
    SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM CTE
GROUP BY 1,2
    

*/ 

SELECT
    LEAST(from_id,to_id) AS person1,
    GREATEST(from_id,to_id) AS person2,
    COUNT(*) AS call_count,
    SUM(duration) AS total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY 1,2
