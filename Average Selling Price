# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**

Two Table: Prices/UnitsSold
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key for Prices table.
There is no primary key for UnitsSold table, it may contain duplicates.

Prices table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
UnitsSold table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold. 

PROBLEM: find the average selling price for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.


STEPS: 
    ROUND(,2) 
    GROUP BY product_id
    ON Prices.product_id = UnitsSold.product_id AND purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
    average selling price = SUM(price*units)/SUM(units)
    Used CTE for making clean code.
    
*/
WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    U.product_id,
    ROUND(SUM(price*units)/SUM(units),2) AS average_price
FROM UnitsSold U
JOIN Prices P
ON 
    U.product_id = P.product_id 
        AND
          (purchase_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date)
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
    product_id,
    average_price
FROM CTE
