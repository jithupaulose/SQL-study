# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
ONE TABLE: Employee
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key for Employee table.
employee_id is the id of the employee.
department_id is the id of the department to which the employee belongs.
primary_flag is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.

PROBLEM: report all the employees with their primary department

STEPS:

SOLUTION 1:
    COALESCE(MAX(), MAX())
    GROUP BY 


SELECT
    employee_id,
    COALESCE(max(CASE WHEN primary_flag = 'Y' THEN department_id ELSE null end), MAX(department_id)) as department_id
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id

SOLUTION 2:


*/
WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    employee_id,
    department_id,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY employee_id ORDER BY primary_flag ) AS rnk
FROM Employee
)

SELECT 
    employee_id,
    department_id
FROM CTE
WHERE rnk = 1
