# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE Table: Ads
(ad_id, user_id) is the primary key of Ads table.
Ads table contains the ID of an Ad, the ID of a user, and the action taken by this user regarding this Ad.


PROBLEM:
 company wants to calculate the performance of each Ad. Calculate the PERFORMANCE
 by Click-Through Rate (CTR)
 TWO CASES:
 if the ads total click + total views = 0 , then CTR = 0
 else total click/(total click + total views)
 
ROUND BY 2 decimal
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id ASC

STEPS:
1. IFNULL for O.00 case
2. ROUND(,2) for round 2 decimal points
3. SUM(IF) for finding the CTR
4. (Action = 'Clicked',1,0)*100/ (Action <> 'Viewed',1,0) for CTR
5. GROUP BY ad_id
6. ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id ASC

*/

SELECT 
    ad_id,
    ROUND(IFNULL(
            SUM(IF(action = 'Clicked',1,0))*100/ SUM(IF(action <> 'Ignored',1,0))
            ,0)
             ,2) AS ctr
FROM Ads
GROUP BY ad_id
ORDER BY ctr DESC, ad_id ASC
