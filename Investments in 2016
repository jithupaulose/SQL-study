# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One Table: Insurance
pid is the primary key column for Insurance table.
Insurance table contains information about one policy where:
    pid is the policyholder's policy ID.
    tiv_2015 is the total investment value in 2015 and tiv_2016 is the total investment value in 2016.
    lat is the latitude of the policy holder's city.
    lon is the longitude of the policy holder's city.
PROBLEM:
Write an SQL query to report the sum of all total investment values in 2016 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:

have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city like any other policyholder (i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).
Round tiv_2016 to two decimal places.

STEPS:
Two Criteria
    Build Two CTEs
    1. tiv_2015 having count(*) > 1
    2. Unique lat,lon having count(*) = 1
    
*/


WITH firstConditionCTE AS
(
SELECT tiv_2015 FROM Insurance GROUP BY tiv_2015 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
),

SecondConditionCTE AS 
(
SELECT lat,lon FROM Insurance GROUP BY lat,lon HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
)

SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(tiv_2016),2) AS tiv_2016
FROM Insurance
WHERE tiv_2015 IN (SELECT * FROM firstConditionCTE)
    AND
    (lat,lon) IN (SELECT * FROM SecondConditionCTE)
