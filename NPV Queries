# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**

Two tables: NPV/Queries
(id, year) is the primary key of NPV table.
(id, year) is the primary key of Queries table.

NPV table has information about the id and the year of each inventory and the corresponding net present value.

Queries table has information about the id and the year of each inventory query.

PROBLEM: find the npv of each query of the Queries table.

STEPS:
    RIGHT JOIN queries table to NPV table
    JOIN with NPV.id = Queries.id and NPV.year = Queries.year
    Either use colasese or ifnull
    IFNULL(N.npv,0) AS npv or coalesce(npv,0) as npv



*/

SELECT
    Q.id,
    Q.year,
    IFNULL(N.npv,0) AS npv
FROM NPV N
RIGHT JOIN Queries Q
ON N.id = Q.id and N.year = Q.year
