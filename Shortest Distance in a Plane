/**
ONE TABLE: Point2D
(x, y) is the primary key column for this table.
Point2D table indicates the position of a point on the X-Y plane.

distance between two points p1(x1, y1) and p2(x2, y2) is sqrt((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2).

PROBLEM: report the shortest distance between any two points from the Point2D table. Round the distance to two decimal points.

STEPS:
    Round the distance to two decimal points : ROUND(,2)
    WITH CTE then call MIN() from CTE
    in CTE, self join 
    x1
    x2
    y1
    y2
    SQRT()
    POWER(,2)
    P1.x <> P2.x or P1.y <> P2.y

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    P1.x AS x1,
    P2.x AS x2,
    P1.y AS y1,
    P2.y AS y2,
    ROUND(SQRT(POW(P2.x - P1.x,2)+ POW(P2.y - P1.y,2)),2) as distance
