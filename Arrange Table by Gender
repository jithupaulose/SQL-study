# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
ONE TABLE: Genders

user_id is the primary key for Genders table.
gender is ENUM of type 'female', 'male', or 'other'.
Genders table contains the ID of a user and their gender.
The table has an equal number of 'female', 'male', and 'other'

PROBLEM:  rearrange the Genders table such that the rows alternate between 'female', 'other', and 'male' in order. The table should be rearranged such that the IDs of each gender are sorted in ascending order.

STEPS:
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id ASC) 
    CASE statement WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1 WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 2 WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 3
    ORDER BY
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    user_id,
    gender,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY user_id ASC) AS rnk,
    CASE WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1
         WHEN gender = 'other' THEN 2
         WHEN gender = 'male' THEN 3 END AS GenderOrder
FROM Genders
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    gender
FROM CTE
ORDER BY rnk,GenderOrder
