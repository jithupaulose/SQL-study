THREE TABLE: SchoolA/SchoolB/SchoolC
student_id is the primary key for all tables.
Each tables contains the name and the id of a student in each schools.

PROBLEM: find all the possible triplets representing the country under the given constraints
        member_A is selected from SchoolA,
        member_B is selected from SchoolB,
        member_C is selected from SchoolC, and
        The selected students' names and IDs are pairwise distinct (i.e. no two students share the same name, and no two students share the same ID).
        
STEPS:
    1. To solve this, we are using cross join. Join everything and make the filter where no id not equals and names not equals
