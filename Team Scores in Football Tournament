/**
Two Tables:Teams/Matches

team_id is the primary key of Teams table.
Teams table represents a single football team.

match_id is the primary key of Matches table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams. 
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the Teams table (team_id), and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals, respectively.

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
A team receives three points if they win a match (i.e., Scored more goals than the opponent team).
A team receives one point if they draw a match (i.e., Scored the same number of goals as the opponent team).
A team receives no points if they lose a match (i.e., Scored fewer goals than the opponent team).

STEPS:
    LEFT JOIN to Teams Table
    GROUP BY Team_ID
    SUM(CASE statements)

SELECT
    team_id,
    team_name,
    SUM(CASE WHEN team_id = host_team AND host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3
         WHEN team_id = guest_team AND guest_goals > host_goals THEN 3
         WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_points
FROM Teams T
LEFT JOIN Matches M ON T.team_id = M.host_team OR T.team_id = M.guest_team
GROUP BY team_id
ORDER BY 3 DESC, 1 ASC
