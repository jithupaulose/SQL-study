/**
THREE Tables : SalesPerson/Company/Orders

sales_id is the primary key column for SalesPerson table.
com_id is the primary key column for Company table.
order_id is the primary key column for Orders table.

SalesPerson table indicates the name and the ID of a salesperson alongside their salary, commission rate, and hire date.
Company table indicates the name and the ID of a company and the city in which the company is located.
Orders table contains information about one order. 

PROBLEM: report the names of all the salespersons who did not have any orders related to the company with the name "RED".

STEPS: 
    BEST Way to solve this by left join all the tables to the main tables
    group by the primary key of the main table
    having sum( case condition where the RED then 1 else 0) is equal to 0;

SELECT 
   S.name
FROM SalesPerson S
LEFT JOIN Orders O
        ON S.sales_id = O.sales_id
LEFT JOIN Company C
        ON O.com_id = C.com_id
GROUP BY S.sales_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN C.name = 'RED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ) = 0
