# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One table: Queue

person_id is the primary key column for Queue table.
Queue table has the information about all people waiting for a bus.

bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board

PROBLEM: find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit.

STEPS:
    WITH CTE self JOIN find the cumilative sum
    WHERE condition
*/

#Solution 1 using SELF JOIN

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    Q1.turn,
    Q1.person_id,
    Q1.person_name ,
    Q1.weight AS Weight,
    SUM(Q2.weight) AS TotalWeight
    
FROM Queue Q1
JOIN Queue Q2
    ON  Q1.turn >= Q2.turn
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(Q2.weight) <= 1000
ORDER BY 1

) 
SELECT 
    person_name 
FROM CTE
ORDER BY TotalWeight DESC
LIMIT 1


# SOLUTION 2


WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    person_name,
    SUM(weight) OVER(ORDER BY turn ASC) as totalWeight
FROM Queue
GROUP BY turn
),
 CTE2 AS
(
SELECT 
    person_name,totalWeight
FROM CTE
HAVING totalWeight <= 1000
ORDER BY totalWeight DESC
LIMIT 1
)
SELECT
    person_name
FROM CTE2


#SOLUTION 3 - Different Style

SELECT 
    A.person_name
FROM 
(
SELECT 
    person_name, turn,
    SUM(weight) OVER(ORDER BY turn ASC) as totalWeight
FROM Queue
) A
WHERE totalWeight <= 1000
GROUP BY turn
ORDER BY totalWeight DESC
    LIMIT 1
