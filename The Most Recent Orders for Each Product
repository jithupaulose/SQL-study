# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
Three Tables: Customers/Orders/Products

customer_id is the primary key for Customers table.
Customers table contains information about the customers.

order_id is the primary key for Orders table.
Orders table contains information about the orders made by customer_id.
There will be no product ordered by the same user more than once in one day.

product_id is the primary key for Products table.
Products table contains information about the Products.

PROBLEM:  find the most recent order(s) of each product.

Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the product_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by order_id in ascending order.

STEPS:
    for each product :  JOIN to Products
    most recent order(s) : DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_date DESC)
    
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    product_id,
    order_id,
    order_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) as rnk
FROM Orders
)
SELECT
    product_name,
    P.product_id,
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM Products P
JOIN CTE C
    ON P.product_id = C.product_id
WHERE rnk = 1
ORDER BY product_name,P.product_id, order_id
