# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two Table: Warehouse/Products
(name, product_id) is the primary key for Warehouse table.
product_id is the primary key for Products table.

Warehouse table contains the information of the products in each warehouse.
Products table contains information about the product dimensions (Width, Lenght, and Height)

JOIN condition: Warehouse.product_id = Products.product_id

PROBLEM: report the number of cubic feet of volume the inventory occupies in each warehouse.

STEPS:
    1. Build a CTE to find the volume of each item from Product Table
    2. JOIN with Warehouse and sum(units * eachVolume) to find the total volume
*/

WITH VolumeCTE AS
(
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name,
    (Width * Length * Height) AS Each_Volume
FROM Products
)
SELECT 
    name AS warehouse_name,
    SUM(units * Each_Volume) AS volume
FROM Warehouse W
JOIN VolumeCTE P
ON W.product_id = P.product_id
group by warehouse_name
