# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two Tables: Buses/Passengers

bus_id is the primary key column for Buses table.
Buses table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the LeetCode station.
No two buses will arrive at the same time.

passenger_id is the primary key column for Passengers table.
Passengers table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the LeetCode station.

PROBLEM: Buses and passengers arrive at the LeetCode station. If a bus arrives at the station at time tbus and a passenger arrived at time tpassenger where tpassenger <= tbus and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus.

Write an SQL query to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by bus_id in ascending order.


STEPS: 

 inner select choose the bus's arrival time that has the smallest postive difference with the passenger's arrival time.
 Boarding time and bus id have 1 to 1 correspondence
