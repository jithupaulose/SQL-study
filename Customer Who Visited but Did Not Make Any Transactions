# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two tables: Visits/Transactions

visit_id is the primary key for Visits table
transaction_id is the primary key for Transactions table

visit_id table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.
Transactions table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id

Joining Condition: Visits.visit_id = Transactions.visit_id

PROBLEM: find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

STEPS:
    1. LEFT JOIN using
    2. distinct customer_id, count(visit_id)
    3. where condition visitor_id null for transaction table
*/

SELECT distinct
       customer_id,
    COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits V
LEFT JOIN Transactions T
ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id
WHERE T.visit_id IS NULL
group by 1


/**
By using WINDOW function, we can solve this problem

select  distinct
    customer_id, 
    count(v.visit_id) over(partition by v.customer_id ) as count_no_trans 
from Visits v
left join Transactions t 
on v.visit_id = t.visit_id 
where t.visit_id is null
