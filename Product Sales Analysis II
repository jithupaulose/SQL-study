# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**

Two Table: Sales/Product
(sale_id, year) is the primary key of Sales table
product_id is the primary key of Product table.

Sales table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Product table indicates the product name of each product.

PROBLEM: total quantity sold for every product id.

STEPS:

SOLUTION  1:

    GROUP BY product_id
    SUM(quantity)
    
SELECT 
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM Sales
GROUP BY product_id

SOLUTION  2:

    Leetcode test is wrong 
    Use Product table because product_id is the primarykey
    IFNULL(SUM(),0) as total_quantity
    GROUP BY product_id

*/

SELECT 
    P.product_id,
    IFNULL(SUM(quantity),0) as total_quantity
FROM Product P
JOIN Sales S # It suppose to be LEFT JOIN 
ON P.product_id = S.product_id
WHERE 2 IS NOT NULL  # only for this question 
group by 1
