/**
CONTEXT:
One Table: Student
Student table indicates the name of a student and the continent they came from.
A school has students from Asia, Europe, and America

PROBLEM:
SQL query to pivot the continent column in the Student table so that each name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding continent

PSUEDO CODE:
1. PIVOT Table. Change the rows to columns. 
2. USE CTE statement
3. ROW_NUMBER() OVER(partiton by continent order by name) rn
4. GROUP BY rn.
5. CASE/IF statement - make the columns
6. Agg a aggragte funct - Min/Max

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        name,
        continent,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) as rn
    FROM Student
)
SELECT
Min(IF(continent = 'America',name,null)) AS 'America',
Min(IF(continent = 'Asia',name,null)) AS 'Asia',
Min(IF(continent = 'Europe',name,null)) AS 'Europe'
FROM CTE
GROUP BY rn;


SOLUTIIN 2:

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
    IF(continent= 'America',name,null) AS America,
    IF(continent= 'Asia',name,null) AS Asia,
    IF(continent= 'Europe',name,null) AS Europe,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY continent ORDER BY name) as rw
    FROM Student

)
SELECT Max(America) America, Max(Asia) Asia, Max(Europe) Europe FROM CTE GROUP BY rw
