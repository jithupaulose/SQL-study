    Find the month: date_format(trans_date,'%Y-%m')
    trans_count = COUNT(state)
    approved_count = SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
    trans_total_amount = SUM(amount)
    approved_total_amount = SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END)

*/

SELECT
    date_format(trans_date,'%Y-%m') AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(state) AS trans_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(amount) AS trans_total_amount,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_total_amount
    
FROM Transactions
