# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
One table: Employees

employee_id is the primary key for Employees table.
Employees table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.

PROBLEM:: A company wants to divide the employees into teams such that all the members on each team have the same salary.
            Each team should consist of at least two employees.
            All the employees on a team should have the same salary
            All the employees of the same salary should be assigned to the same team
            A team's ID is assigned based on the rank of the team's salary relative to the other teams' salaries, where the team with the lowest salary has team_id = 1
            
            SQL query to get the team_id of each employee that is in a team.
            ordered by team_id,employee_id in ascending order. 
            
STEPS:
    WITH CTE find all group by salary having count(*) > 1 
    THEN inner join with the Employee table on salery. so we will get all salary. 
    Using DENSE_RANK() we can create the team_id

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        name,
        salary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY salary
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT
    Emp.employee_id,
    Emp.name,
    Emp.salary, 
    DENSE_RANK() OVER( ORDER BY Emp.salary) AS team_id
FROM Employees Emp
JOIN CTE 
    ON Emp.salary = CTE.salary
ORDER BY team_id, 1
