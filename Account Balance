https://leetcode.com/problems/account-balance/

# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Transactions

(account_id, day) is the primary key for this table.


PROBLEM: report the balance of each user after each transaction

STEPS:
CUMILATTIVE SUM . So we can use SELF JOIN 

*/
# FIRST APPROACH - using SELF JOIN 

SELECT
    T1.account_id,
    T1.day,
    SUM(CASE WHEN T2.type = 'Deposit' THEN T2.amount 
             WHEN T2.type = 'Withdraw' THEN -T2.amount ELSE 0 END
       ) AS balance
FROM Transactions T1
JOIN Transactions T2
ON  T1.account_id = T2.account_id AND T1.day >= T2.day
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2

# SECOND APPROACH - using WINDOW FUNCTION

SELECT 
    account_id,
    day,
    SUM( CASE WHEN type = 'Deposit' THEN amount
              WHEN type = 'Withdraw' THEN -amount
        ELSE 0 END
       ) OVER( PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY account_id, day ) AS balance
FROM Transactions
