# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
ONE TABLE: Tree
    
id is the primary key column for Tree table.
Tree table contains information about the id of a node and the id of its parent node in a tree.
The given structure is always a valid tree.

Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
        "Leaf": if the node is a leaf node.
        "Root": if the node is the root of the tree.
        "Inner": If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.

SELECT
    id,
    (CASE WHEN p_id IS NULL THEN 'Root'
        WHEN p_id IS NOT NULL AND id in (SELECT p_id FROM Tree) THEN 'Inner'
        ELSE 'Leaf' END) AS type
FROM Tree
ORDER BY id
