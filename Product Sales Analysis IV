PROBLEM: reports for each user the product id on which the user spent the most money.

STEPS:
  
WITH CTE + dense_rank() partition by the user_id . order by sum of quantity * price
GROUP BY product_id, user_id

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    S.product_id,
    S.user_id,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(partition by user_id order by SUM(quantity * price) desc) as rnk
FROM Sales S
JOIN Product P
ON S.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT 
    user_id,
    product_id
FROM CTE 
WHERE rnk = 1
