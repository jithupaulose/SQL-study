/**
Two Tables: Contests/Users

contest_id is the primary key for Contests table.
Contests table contains the LeetCode contest ID and the user IDs of the gold, silver, and bronze medalists.
It is guaranteed that any consecutive contests have consecutive IDs and that no ID is skipped.

user_id is the primary key for Users table.
Users table contains information about the users.

PROBLEM:
report the name and the mail of all interview candidates.
A user is an interview candidate if at least one of these two conditions is true.
    The user won any medal in three or more consecutive contests.
    The user won the gold medal in three or more different contests (not necessarily consecutive). 
    
STEPS:
    MedalWithUsers JOIN ALL
    LEAD()
