# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
TWO TABLES: Users/Register
user_id is the primary key for Users table.
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key for Register table.

Users table contains the name and the id of a user.
Register table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.


PROBLEM: find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.
     order by percentage desc
     order by contest_id asc
     
STEPS:
    Using CTE, First find the count of user_id from Users table. DONT do distinct, because it is primary key
    GROUP BY contest_id
    ROUND()
    100 * COUNT(user_id) / cnt from the other table
    
    
    
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    COUNT(user_id) as cnt
FROM Users
)
SELECT 
    contest_id,
    ROUND(100 * COUNT(user_id)/cnt, 2) AS percentage
FROM Register
JOIN CTE 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1 ASC
