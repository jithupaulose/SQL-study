# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Table: Orders
order_id is the primary key column for Orders table.
Orders table indicates the ID of an order, the ID of the customer who ordered it, and the order type.

PROBLEM: SQL query to report all the orders based on the following criteria:
    If a customer has at least one order of type 0, do not report any order of type 1 from that customer.
    Otherwise, report all the orders of the customer.

STEPS:

        If a customer has at least one order of type 0, 
        do not report any order of type 1 from that customer::::::
        dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id ORDER BY order_type ASC) as rnk
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_type,
    dense_rank() over(partition by customer_id ORDER BY order_type  asc) as rnk
FROM Orders
)

SELECT  
    order_id,
    customer_id, 
    order_type
FROM CTE
WHERE rnk = 1
