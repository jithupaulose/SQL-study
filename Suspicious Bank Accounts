# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two Tables: Accounts/Transactions

account_id is the primary key for Accounts table.
Accounts row contains information about the maximum monthly income for one bank account.

transaction_id is the primary key for Transactions table.
Transactions row contains information about one transaction.

A bank account is suspicious if the total income exceeds the max_income for this account for two or more consecutive months. The total income of an account in some month is the sum of all its deposits in that month (i.e., transactions of the type 'Creditor').

Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all suspicious bank accounts.
