/*
Two tables: Boxes/Chests

box_id is the primary key for Boxes table.
chest_id is a foreign key of the chests table.
Boxes table contains information about the boxes and the number of oranges and apples they have. Each box may include a chest, which also can contain oranges and apples.

chest_id is the primary key for Chests table.
Chests table contains information about the chests and the corresponding number of oranges and apples they have.

PROBLEM:  count the number of apples and oranges in all the boxes. If a box contains a chest, you should also include the number of apples and oranges it has.


STEPS: 
    LEFT JOIN ON chest_id
    SUM() + coalesce/ifnull

*/
SELECT 
    SUM(B.apple_count + coalesce(C.apple_count,0)) AS apple_count,
    SUM(B.orange_count + coalesce(C.orange_count,0)) AS orange_count
FROM Boxes B
LEFT JOIN Chests C
ON B.chest_id = C.chest_id
