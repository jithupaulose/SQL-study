# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
THREE tables Person || Country || Calls
id is the primary key of Person table
country_code is the primary key of Country table
No primary keys in Calls table

Each row of Person table contains the name of a person and their phone number. 
Each row of  Country table contains the country name and its code
Each row of Calls table contains the caller id, callee id and the duration of the call in minutes. caller_id != callee_id

Phone number will be in the form 'xxx-yyyyyyy. xxx is the country code (3 characters) and yyyyyyy is the phone number (7 characters) where x and y are digits. Both can contain leading zeros.
country_code will be in the form 'xxx' where x is digits.

PROBLEM:  A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. The company intends to invest in the countries where the average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.

1. Find average call duration of the calls in this country
2. global average call duration.

To find  ::::  find the countries where this company can invest.


STEPS:::

 Create dataset with each person and their country
 Create dataset with all calls and duration in which each person was either the caller or the callee
 JOIN datasets on person ID, group by country, and filter on average duration using subquery
 



with all_calls as (

    select caller_id as person, duration from calls
    union all
    select callee_id as person, duration from calls

)

select c.name as country
from person as p
join country as c
on c.country_code = left(p.phone_number, 3)
join all_calls as a
on p.id = a.person
group by 1
having avg(duration) > (select avg(duration) from calls)
*/
#Second Apporoach
 

WITH allPersonsCall AS
(
SELECT
    caller_id AS person, duration
FROM Calls
    UNION ALL
SELECT
    callee_id AS person, duration
FROM Calls
)

SELECT
C.name AS country
FROM Person P
JOIN Country C ON SUBSTRING(P.phone_number,1,3) = C.country_code
JOIN allPersonsCall A ON A.person = P.id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING AVG(A.duration) > (SELECT AVG(duration) FROM Calls)
