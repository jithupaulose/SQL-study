    GROUP BY ACTIVITY
    
*/
WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT 
        activity,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(activity) ASC)  AS lowRnk,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(activity) DESC) AS highRnk
FROM Friends
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    activity
FROM CTE
WHERE lowRnk <> 1 AND highRnk <> 1
