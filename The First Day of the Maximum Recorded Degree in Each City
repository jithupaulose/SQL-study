    WITH CTE + DENSE_RANK() OVER(partition by city_id ORDER BY degree desc, day ASC)
    
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        city_id,
        day,
        degree,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY city_id ORDER BY degree DESC, day ASC) AS rnk
    FROM Weather
)
SELECT
    city_id,
    day,
    degree
FROM CTE
WHERE rnk = 1
