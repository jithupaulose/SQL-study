# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
ONE Table Activity
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key 
Activity table shows the activity of players of some games.

PROBLEM: report the first login date for each player

STEPS:
Solution 1 :
    with CTE and help of dense_rank()
    dense_rank() over(partition by player_id order by event_date asc)
    
WITH ActivityFirstLogin AS
(
SELECT distinct
    player_id,
    device_id,
    event_date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) as Rnk
FROM Activity
)
SELECT 
    player_id,
    event_date AS first_login
FROM ActivityFirstLogin
WHERE Rnk =1
    
Solution 2:
    MIN(event_date) with GROUP BY player_id

*/


SELECT 
    player_id,
    MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
