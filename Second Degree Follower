# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One table: Follow
(followee, follower) is the primary key column for this table.
Follow table indicates that the user follower follows the user followee on a social network.

PROBLEM:
Write an SQL query to report the second-degree users and the number of their followers.

A second-degree follower is a user who:
    follows at least one user, and
    is followed by at least one user.
ordered by follower.

STEPS:
    INNER JOIN eliminates the rows which has zero follows by the user.

*/

SELECT
F1.follower, COUNT(DISTINCT F2.follower) AS num
FROM Follow F1
JOIN Follow F2 ON F1.follower = F2.followee
GROUP BY 1


SOLUTION 2:

WITH CTE AS
(

    SELECT
    followee as follower,
    count(*) as num
    FROM Follow
    GROUP BY 1
) 
SELECT * FROM CTE
WHERE follower IN (SELECT follower FROM Follow)
ORDER BY 1
