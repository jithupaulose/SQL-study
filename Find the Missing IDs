# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Customers

customer_id is the primary key for Customers table.
Customers table contains the name and the id customer.

PROBLEM: find the missing customer IDs.
        missing IDs are ones that are not in the Customers table but are in the range between 1 and the maximum customer_id present in the table.
       maximum customer_id will not exceed 100. 
        ordered by ids in ascending order.
        
STEPS:
    USING recursive CTE find the 1 to 100 as ids
    THEN find the max(id) and keep id <= max(id) and id not in the customer table.

WITH RECURSIVE CTE AS
(
    SELECT 
        1 AS ids
  UNION
    SELECT 
        ids + 1
    FROM CTE
    WHERE ids < 100
    
)
SELECT 
    ids
FROM CTE
WHERE ids <= (SELECT MAX(customer_id) FROM Customers) 
    AND
    ids NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM Customers) 
ORDER BY 1
