/**
Two Table:Signups/Confirmations
user_id is the primary key for Signups table.
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for Confirmations table.

Signups contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
Confirmations table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').


A.time_stamp >= DATE_SUB(B.time_stamp, INTERVAL 24 HOUR)
