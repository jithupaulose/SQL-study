/**
TWO TABLES: Trips AND Users


Find the canellation Rate: 
no of cancelled by client or driver requests by unbanned users/total no of requests by unbanned users. IN a day

ROUND(,2)
between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03"


To SOLVE:

1. Join the Trips table with the Users table based on client_id and driver_id, ensuring that neither the client nor the driver is banned.

2. Filter the joined table for the specified dates.

3. Group by the request_at date.

4. Calculate the cancellation rate by dividing the number of canceled trips by the total number of trips for each date.
