# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**

Two tables: Employees/Logs

employee_id is the primary key for Employees table.
Employees contains the id of an employee and the minimum number of hours needed for them to work to get their salary.

(employee_id, in_time, out_time) is the primary key for this table.
Logs table shows the time stamps for an employee.

PROBLEM: report the IDs of the employees that did not work the needed hours.

STEPS:::
1. LEFT JOIN Logs table to Employees
2. GROUP BY employee_id,needed_hours
3. HAVING needed for checking the employees total working hour less than the needed hour

Total Working Hour = find thetotal sum( convert into hours , So /60)
    CEIL(/60) is used for rounding off the minites. 
    TIMESTAMPDIFF(second,,) for getting the actual work
    IFNULL(,0) for if something missed while left join 
*/
SELECT
E.employee_id
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN Logs L
ON E.employee_id = L.employee_id
GROUP BY E.employee_id,E.needed_hours
HAVING E.needed_hours >
SUM(
CEIL(IFNULL(TIMESTAMPDIFF(second, in_time, out_time),0)/60)
/60);
