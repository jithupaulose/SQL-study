# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Delivery
delivery_id is the primary key of Delivery table.
Delivery table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

PROBLEM:  find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

immediate orders:::If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate.
rounded to 2 decimal places::: ROUND(,2)


*/



SELECT
ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END))*100/COUNT(delivery_id),2) AS immediate_percentage

FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id,order_date) IN 
    (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) FROM Delivery GROUP BY 1)


SOLUTION 2:


WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
    delivery_id,
    customer_id,
    CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN "immediate" ELSE
    "scheduled" END AS OrderType,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date ASC) AS rnk
    FROM Delivery 
)
SELECT 
ROUND(SUM(IF(OrderType = 'immediate',1,0))*100/COUNT(customer_id),2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM CTE WHERE rnk = 1
