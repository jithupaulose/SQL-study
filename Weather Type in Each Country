# Write your MySQL query statement below


/**

Two Table: Countries/Weather

country_id is the primary key for Countries table.
(country_id, day) is the primary key for Weather table.

Countries table contains the ID and the name of one country.
Weather table indicates the weather state in a country for one day.

PROBLEM: find the type of weather in each country for November 2019.
        Cold if the average weather_state is less than or equal 15,
        Hot if the average weather_state is greater than or equal to 25, and
        Warm otherwise.

STEPS:
    WITH CTE Find the avg, each month using date_format()
    Group by using countryid , month
    CASE Statement
    
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT  
    country_id,
    date_format(day,'%Y-%m') as month,
    AVG(weather_state) as totalsum
FROM Weather
WHERE  date_format(day,'%Y-%m') LIKE '2019-11%'
GROUP BY 1,2
   
)
SELECT 
    country_name,
    CASE WHEN totalsum <= 15 THEN 'Cold'
        WHEN totalsum >= 25 THEN 'Hot'
        ELSE 'Warm' END AS weather_type
FROM CTE
LEFT JOIN Countries C
ON CTE.country_id = C.country_id
