# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Employees
employee_id is the primary key for Employees table.
Employees table contains information about the employees and the id of the manager they report to.
Some employees do not report to anyone (reports_to is null). 

PROBLEM: report the ids and the names of all managers, the number of employees who report directly to them, and the average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer

STEPS:
    report the ids and the names of all managers: SELF JOIN where E.reports_to :: M.employee_id and where E.reports_to is not null
    number of employees who report directly to them :: COUNT(employee_id of E table)
    average age of the reports rounded to the nearest integer:: ROUND(,0), AVG(age in employee table)
    GROUP BY M.employee_id
    
    
    
*/

SELECT
    M.employee_id,
    M.name,
    COUNT(E.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    round(avg(E.age),0) AS average_age
FROM Employees E
JOIN Employees M
ON E.reports_to = M.employee_id
WHERE E.reports_to IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
