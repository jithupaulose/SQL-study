# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Rides
ride_id is the primary key for Rides table.
Rides table contains the ID of the driver and the ID of the passenger that rode in ride_id.
Note that driver_id != passenger_id.

PROBLEM: report the ID of each driver and the number of times they were a passenger.

STEPS:
    SELF JOIN: Need to count from the same table
    COUNT(DISTINCT ride_id)
    LEFT JOIN Rides 
        ON driver_id = passenger_id
    
*/



SELECT
    A.driver_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT B.ride_id) AS cnt
FROM Rides A
 LEFT JOIN Rides B
    ON A.driver_id = B.passenger_id
group by 1
