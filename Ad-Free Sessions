# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**

TWO TABLES:Playback/Ads
session_id is the primary key for Playback table.
session runs during the inclusive interval between start_time and end_time.
guaranteed that start_time <= end_time and that two sessions for the same customer do not intersect.

ad_id is the primary key for Ads table.
customer_id is the ID of the customer viewing this ad.

PROBLEM: report all the sessions that did not get shown any ads.

STEPS:
    LEFT JOIN BOTH TABLES USING Playback.customer_id = Ads.customer_id
    AND timestamp not between start_time and end_time
    FILTER with the customer_id empty for the second one.

SELECT 
    session_id
FROM Playback Pb
LEFT JOIN Ads Ad
ON Pb.customer_id = Ad.customer_id
                    AND (timestamp BETWEEN start_time AND end_time) 
WHERE Ad.customer_id is null
