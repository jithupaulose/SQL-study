book_id is the primary key of Books table.

order_id is the primary key of Orders table.
book_id is a foreign key to the Books table.

STEPS:
Books LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Books.book_id = Orders.book_id
where condition find the books who realased more than one month using ::::DATE_SUB
GROUP BY using the book_ID
having sum(case when dispatch_date >= DATE_SUB(dispatch_date,interval 1 year) then quantity else 0 end) < 10
*/

SELECT
    B.book_id,
    B.name
FROM Books B
LEFT JOIN Orders O
ON B.book_id = O.book_id
WHERE available_from < DATE_SUB('2019-06-23', INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN dispatch_date > DATE_SUB('2019-06-23', INTERVAL 1 YEAR) THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) < 10 ;
