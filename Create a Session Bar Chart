# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One table: Sessions
session_id is the primary key for Sessions table.
Duration is the time in seconds that a user has visited the application.

PROBLEM:  create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>", and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it. Report the (bin, total)

STEPS:
    Two CTE. One for the name classification. Second one for the duration spilt classification
    GROUP BY Name.bin and take the count(Group.bin) for total
