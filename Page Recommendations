# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two Table: Friendship, Likes

(user1_id, user2_id) is the primary key for Friendship table.
Friendship table indicates that there is a friendship relation between user1_id and user2_id.

(user_id, page_id) is the primary key for Likes table.
Likes table indicates that user_id likes page_id.

PROBLEM: Write an SQL query to recommend pages to the user with user_id = 1 using the pages that your friends liked. It should not recommend pages you already liked.


STEPS:
    WITH CTE 
    find the user1_id FROM Friendship who have user2_id = 1
    UNION 
    find the user2_id FROM Friendship who have user1_id = 1
    (so we will get the all the friends of 1)
    
    FIND the distinct page_id from Likes table with WHERE condition.
       user_id = select all user_id from CTE
        AND need to remove the one that 1 already liked
        
*/

WITH AllFriendTable AS
(
    SELECT 
        user1_id AS user_id
    FROM Friendship
        WHERE user2_id = 1
UNION
    SELECT 
        user2_id AS user_id
    FROM Friendship
        WHERE user1_id = 1
)

SELECT 

    DISTINCT page_id  AS recommended_page
FROM Likes
WHERE user_id IN (SELECT user_id FROM AllFriendTable)
    AND 
    page_id NOT IN (SELECT page_id FROM Likes WHERE user_id = 1)
