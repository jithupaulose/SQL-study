purchase_id is the primary key for Purchases table.
Purchases table contains logs of the dates that users purchased from a certain retailer.

PROBLEM:
report the IDs of the users that made any two purchases at most 7 days apart.

Return the result table ordered by user_id.

STEPS:

    Using CTE find the Next purchasedate using LAG() over partition by userid, order by date
    SELECT the distinct user_id FROM cte where DATEDIFF(blw the lagdate and purchase date) <=7
    group by using the user_id
    having statement count(user_id) <= 2 
*/
WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    user_id,
    purchase_date,
    Lag(purchase_date) OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY purchase_date) AS nextDate
FROM Purchases
)

SELECT
     user_id
FROM CTE
WHERE DATEDIFF(purchase_date,nextDate) <=7
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(user_id) <=2
