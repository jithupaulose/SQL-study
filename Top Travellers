# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two tables: Users/Rides
id is the primary key for Users table
id is the primary key for Rides table.

name is the name of the user table.
user_id is the id of the user who traveled the distance "distance".

JOIN condition: Users.id = Rides.user_id

PROBLEM: report the distance traveled by each user.

STEPS:

    LEFT JOIN to users tables
    IFNULL(SUM(distaince),0) / COALESCE(SUM(distaince),O)
    ORDER BY travelled_distance DESC, name ASC
    GROUP BY id
    
*/

SELECT
    name, 
    ifnull(SUM(distance),0) AS travelled_distance
FROM Users U
LEFT JOIN Rides R
ON  U.id = R.user_id
GROUP BY U.id
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1
