# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One table: Activity

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
Activity table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

PROBLEM:
Write an SQL query to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

The query result format is in the following example.

STEPS:
    Using CTE find the min(event_date)
    

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    player_id, 
    MIN(event_date) AS firstDate
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT
     ROUND(COUNT(A.player_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity),2) AS fraction
FROM CTE C
JOIN Activity A
    ON C.player_id = A.player_id
WHERE DATEDIFF(event_date,firstDate) = 1
