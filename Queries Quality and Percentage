# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
ONE TABLE: Queries
There is no primary key for Queries table.

PROBLEM: find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

quality :   ratio between query rating and its position
            poor query percentage :  percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.
            rounded to 2 decimal places

STEPS:
    ROUND(,2)
    GROUP BY query_name
    SUM(rating/position)/COUNT(*) for quality
    SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100/COUNT(*) for poor_query_percentage
    
            
*/

SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(SUM(rating/position)/COUNT(*), 2) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100/COUNT(*) , 2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name
