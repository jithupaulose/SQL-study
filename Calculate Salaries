WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    company_id,
    CASE WHEN MAX(salary) < 1000 THEN 0
         WHEN MAX(salary) BETWEEN 1000 AND 10000 THEN .24
         WHEN MAX(salary) > 10000 THEN .49 END
    AS tax_rates
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY company_id
) 

SELECT 
    S.company_id,
    S.employee_id,
    S.employee_name,
    ROUND(S.salary - (S.salary * C.tax_rates),0) as salary
FROM Salaries S
LEFT JOIN CTE C
ON S.company_id = C.company_id
