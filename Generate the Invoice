# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
CONTEXT:
TWO TABLES: Products & Purchases

product_id is the primary key for Products table.
Products table shows the ID of a product and the price of one unit.

(invoice_id, product_id) is the primary key for Purchases table.
Purchases table shows the quantity ordered from one product in an invoice.


PROBLEM:
SQL query to show the details of the invoice with the highest price.
If two or more invoices have the same price, return the details of the one with the smallest invoice_id.

PSEDO CODE:
1. WITH CTE statement
2. JOIN Both Tables on product_id and find the highest price invoice. LIMIT 1 and ORDER BY 
3. JOIN CTE tables with both tables and find the required fields

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
    
        P1.invoice_id,
        SUM(P2.price * P1.quantity) AS price
    
    FROM Purchases P1
    JOIN Products  P2
        ON P1.product_id = P2.product_id
    GROUP BY P1.invoice_id
    ORDER BY 2 DESC,1 ASC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT

    P.product_id,
    SUM(P.quantity) AS quantity,
    SUM(quantity*Pr.price) AS price

FROM Purchases P
JOIN CTE C
    ON P.invoice_id = C.invoice_id
JOIN Products Pr
    ON Pr.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY 1

WITH CTE AS

        P1.invoice_id, 
        SUM(quantity*price) AS price1
    FROM Purchases P1
    LEFT JOIN Products P2

    (P2.quantity * P1.price) AS price
FROM Products P1
LEFT JOIN Purchases P2 
ON P1.product_id = P2.product_id
WHERE invoice_id IN (SELECT invoice_id FROM CTE)
