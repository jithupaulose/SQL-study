# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One table:UserVisits

UserVisits table does not have a primary key.
UserVisits table contains logs of the dates that users visited a certain retailer.

PROBLEM:  SQL query that will, for each user_id, find out the largest window of days between each visit and the one right after it (or today if you are considering the last visit).
    ordered by user_id.
    
STEPS:
    GROUP BY user_id
    FIND THE LARGEST Window : LEAD(, 1, '2021-1-1') over(partition by user_id order by visit_date)
    MAX(DATEDIFF())

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        user_id,
        visit_date,
        LEAD(visit_date,1,'2021-1-1') OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY visit_date) AS nextDay
    FROM UserVisits
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    MAX(DATEDIFF(nextDay,visit_date)) AS biggest_window
