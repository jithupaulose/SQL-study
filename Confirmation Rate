# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Two Tables: Signups/Confirmations

user_id is the primary key for Signups table.
Signups table contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.

(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for Confirmations table.
Confirmations table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').

PROBLEM: 
    find the confirmation rate of each user
    confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages.
    ROUND(,2)
    
STEPS:
    WITH CTE find the number of userid who action is confirmed and total no
    SUM(CASE statement) & COUNT(no of actions)
    ROUND(,2)
    IFNULL(,0)
*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    user_id,
    SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS totalConfirmed,
    COUNT(action) AS totalAction
FROM Confirmations
GROUP BY user_id
)

SELECT
    S.user_id,
    ROUND(IFNULL(SUM(totalConfirmed/totalAction),0),2) AS confirmation_rate
FROM Signups S
LEFT JOIN CTE C
ON S.user_id = C.user_id
GROUP BY 1
