# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**

One Table: Activity

Activity table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key of Activity table.

PROBLEM: Find the average time each machine takes to complete a process

STEPS:
    WITH CTE 
    find the COUNT( DISTINCT process_id) for the total process.
    SUM(CASE statement) for getting the sum of start and end time.
    GROUP BY machine_id
    DIVIDE the Totalprocessing_time/ total process to get the AVG time.
    ROUND(,3)
    

*/

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    machine_id,
    COUNT( DISTINCT process_id ) as total_process,
    SUM( CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN -timestamp ELSE timestamp END ) AS Totalprocessing_time
FROM Activity
GROUP BY machine_id
)
SELECT
    machine_id,
    ROUND((Totalprocessing_time/total_process),3) processing_time
FROM CTE
