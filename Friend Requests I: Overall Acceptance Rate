# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
TWO tables FriendRequest/RequestAccepted
SENDER_ID and SEND_TO_ID with the date of the request in FriendRequest table.
requester_id and accepter_id with the accept_date in RequestAccepted table.
Both table have no primary keys for both tables


PROBLEM: find the overall acceptance rate of requests
NO of acceptance/ NO of requests
Round by 2 decimal
Need the distinct values of sender and reciever
No request keep 0.00 means coalesce add

STEPS
    Create CTE for accepted from RequestAccepted and send from FriendRequest
    need count distinct pair (sender_id,send_to_id) & (requester_id,accepter_id)
    divide both count by round of 2 decimal with coalese()/ifnull()
*/

WITH Send AS 
(
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) AS send_cnt
    FROM FriendRequest
),

Accept AS 
(
    SELECT 
        COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) AS accept_cnt
    FROM RequestAccepted
)

SELECT 
   Round(IFNULL(accept_cnt/send_cnt,0.00),2) AS accept_rate
FROM Accept,Send
