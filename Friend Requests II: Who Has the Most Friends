# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
One Table: RequestAccepted

(requester_id, accepter_id) is the primary key for RequestAccepted table.
RequestAccepted table contains the ID of the user who sent the request, the ID of the user who received the request, and the date when the request was accepted.

PROBLEM: find the people who have the most friends and the most friends number.

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    requester_id AS user,
    accepter_id  AS friend
FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
SELECT
    accepter_id AS user,
    requester_id  AS friend
FROM RequestAccepted
)
SELECT 
    user id,
    count(distinct friend) as num
FROM CTE
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1


SOLUTION 2:

WITH CTE AS
(
    SELECT
        requester_id AS id,
        accepter_id AS friend
    FROM RequestAccepted
    UNION ALL
    SELECT
        accepter_id AS id,
        requester_id AS friend
    FROM RequestAccepted
),
CTE_rnk AS
(
    SELECT 
        id,
        COUNT(*) AS num,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM CTE
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
id,
num
FROM CTE_rnk
WHERE rnk = 1
