# Write your MySQL query statement below

/**
ONE TABLE: Employees
employee_id is the primary key for Employees table.
Employees table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager. Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null).

PROBLEM: report the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company.

TWO WAYS to solve this 
SELECT 
    employee_id
FROM Employees
WHERE salary < 30000 AND manager_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM Employees)
ORDER BY 1

*/
SELECT 
    E.employee_id
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN Employees M
ON E.manager_id = M.employee_id
WHERE E.salary < 30000
        AND E.manager_id is not null
                AND M.employee_id is null
ORDER BY 1
