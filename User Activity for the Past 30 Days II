# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
one Table: Activity
There are no primary key. Might contain duplicate rows
Activity table contain user activities for a social media website.
activity_type is ENUM

PROBLEM:
average number of sessions per user for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27
rounded to 2 decimal places

STEPS:
 1. Build a CTE which get the COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) AND COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
 2. FILTER which activity_date blw the date and 30 days before DATE_SUB(, INTERVAL 20 DAY)
 3. SELECT THE COUNT(DISTINCT session_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) in IFNULL
 4. WITH ROUND 2 decimal also
*/


WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT 
    COUNT( DISTINCT session_id) AS sessCount,
     COUNT( DISTINCT user_id) AS userIDcount
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND '2019-07-27'
)

SELECT 
    IFNULL(ROUND(sessCount/userIDcount,2),0) AS average_sessions_per_user
FROM CTE
