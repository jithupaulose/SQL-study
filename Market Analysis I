# Write your MySQL query statement below
/**
Three Tables: Users/Orders/Items

user_id is the primary key of Users table.
Users table has the info of the users of an online shopping website where users can sell and buy items.

order_id is the primary key of Orders table.
item_id is a foreign key to the Items table.
buyer_id and seller_id are foreign keys to the Users table.

item_id is the primary key of Items table.

STEPS:
Write an SQL query to find for each user, the join date and the number of orders they made as a buyer in 2019.

STEPS:
Find for each user, the join date::: LEFT JOIN TO Users Table GROUP BY user_id
number of orders they made as a buyer in 2019::: year(order_date) = 2019 IFNULL(COUNT(order_id),0) 
JOIN BY user_id = buyer_id

*/

SELECT
    U.user_id AS buyer_id,
    join_date,
    IFNULL(COUNT(order_id),0) AS orders_in_2019
FROM Users U
LEFT JOIN Orders O
ON U.user_id = O.buyer_id AND year(order_date) = 2019
GROUP BY 1
