# Write your MySQL query statement below


/**
Why  p1.id < p2.id ??
e.g. (2,3) and (3,2) are the same pair, and we only want one of them. Since these two combinations have the same area, we are asked to order them by p1.id ascending -> p1.id should be smaller than p2.id when there is a tie in area.
